Assignment to create an heroimage/video and using img as background.
Create a form connected to https bin and accordion with js script. 

## The problem
Google around, look into SO and slack channels. 
Asked a team mate concerning the video tag as it wasn't uploading in iphone or ipad.
Had another bug once trying the form and accordion in smaller devices, which I solved by using the inspector tool. 
If I had more time I would have played around more with the JS script.
The finishing fixfor smaller devices after the netlify publishing,  did take more time than expected
